A project can be a gradle project if it has build.gradle file.

gradlew & gradlew.bat are two files that are std and shipped so that it will install the gradle that will make
the gradle distribution homogenous all around. Along with this we need to have gradle folder that has gradle-wrapper.jar and gradle-wrapper-properties

These gradlew properties can be updated using command line. These define what version of gradle to be used and all.
If we dont want to update gradlew using command line then we can put this in build.gradle
task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '4.6'
}
and run gradlew so that it updates the gradle-wrapper.properties file. Then you can remove this task.

To setup your gradle using gradle wrapper run ./gradlew build
